## Background and Problem

Jake and his work mates absolutely love pies! In fact, they love pies so much, that they only eat them for lunch. They hate going out of their comfort zone to try out other lovely foods such as: fried rice, banh mi, pho, sushi, fried chicken, etc. Jake and friends tend to order their pies at 10am sharp, so they are guarenteed to get the pies they want (Jake usually mixes it up and goes to a different pie shop for each day of the week). Each pie shop has a 'Pie of the day' that are typically cheaper than the other pies. Jake calls up each shop he knows to find out which shop has the cheapest 'Pie of the day'. Jake and friends only get the 'Pie of the day' since they love variety in their pies and it's cheap. Jake places the order and once it reaches lunch time, Jake and friends go to their selected store to collect their pies.

However, since the price of 'Pie of the day' at each shop changes each day, Jake find's it a pain to call up each shop to find out which 'Pie of the day' is cheapest. He would really like a web application that would make this process easier for him.

## Wireframes

My wireframes focus on a simple yet responsive design. For the pie list, it uses a very familiar card design which includes the information about the Pie and its corresponding store. It also includes a color-coded rating marker box similar to Zomato and Rotten Tomatoes.

The idea for the design is to have a listed card layout but with the features of a filterable data table which can sort data and search keywords.

## Styling Framework

The styling framework used for this project is `Bootstrap 4`. Bootstrap 4 provides cross-browser compatibility and a very useful set of classes which makes styling a lot easier. The card layout also fits the design that was established in my wireframes.

For the fonts, I chose to use `Lobster` for the app's heading and `Raleway` for the rest of the page. With a little bit of research, I found that this is a good combination to have in restaurant/food websites.


## HTTP Client

The HTTP client of choice for this project is `Axios`. Among all the HTTP client libraries, Axios is the one that I am most familiar with. It provides easy setup for configurations such as base URLs and authentication tokens. It also works really well with the `async/await` syntax as it is a Promise-based HTTP client.
